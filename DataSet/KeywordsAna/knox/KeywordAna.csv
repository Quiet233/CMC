This patch modifies HadoopAuthCookieStore to accept cookies with

It also updates a check that is used to ensure the cookie belongs to

specific format that Hadoop uses for its cookies and ensures that the
Knox principal appears in the expected location.

Impala uses a similar cookie format, but with a few changes such as
fields being in a different order. The check is made more permissive
such that it will accept any cookie that contains the Knox principal
anywhere in it.

  Impala's cookies as expected.",100.0,No_arch,0.8674

This patch adds a new service definition for accessing Apache Kudu's web UI.

Like Apache Impala, every server has a web UI, so we use scheme/host/port
query parameters to disambiguate between servers. Unlike Impala, the Kudu
web UI will add /KNOX-BASE tokens to URLs in its web pages when it detects
it is being proxied by Knox; we use these tokens as the basis for pattern
matching in our rewrite rules.

I tried to avoid cargo culting from existing service definitions and I added
comments to explain syntax and other things that weren't obvious to me as a
non-Knox developer.

I tested this manually by deploying a small Kudu cluster on my machine along
with a Knox gateway and a really simple topology. I then browsed every page
in the web UI and verified its correct behavior.",100.0,No_arch,0.0772

HttpClient 4.5.7 broke url normalization. Knox
didn't have any tests for this case and so we
had to revert after the fact. HttpClient 4.5.8
fixed a lot of the url normalization and some
libraries decided to turn url normalization off.

This commit does the following:
* Adds a test for %2F - KNOX-1005
    * This test passes under HttpClient 4.5.6 and 4.5.8+
    * It breaks as expected under HttpClient 4.5.7
* Adds an explicit config enabling url normalization
    * Ensures that we are in control of url normalization
    * Adds a test for this configuration as well
* Test with both HttpClient normalization enabled and disabled
    * `rest-assured` doesn't expose `RequestConfig` to disable
url normalization
    * Shows how to use HttpClient in `GatewayBasicFuncTest`

All the url safe characters like %2F are fixed by HTTPCLIENT-1968.

The case of `/abc///def` is normalized to `/abc/def` the same
way that Knox does internally with `getPathInfo` and Java URI.

Fix DefaultTokenStateServiceTest timeouts to be more
reasonable. I used TimeUnit every where to ensure we
are doing things with the correct unit of time.
Previously there were issues where milliseconds and
seconds were being mixed. This caused race conditions
in AliasBasedTokenStateServiceTest which extends
DefaultTokenStateServiceTest.

* KNOX-2354 An HBASEJARS service which can proxy HBase jars hosted by the HBASEUI

In HBase, we can host a ""mini"" maven repo in hbase itself which a maven
application can point to.

We want this to be in its own service because it has different semantics
than the normal hbaseUI service has (e.g. one would be hooked up to SSO
login, but SSO won't work against that), and Maven cannot function with
the query-string based backend-routing that we do to make the HBaseUI
look like a normal website (instead of a collection of independent
webservers).

Main changes in this commit:
- implemented a language that Knox understands when parsing shared provider configuration(s) in Haddop XML type descriptors
- XML/JSON provider configurations are moved out to their own classes from ProviderConfigurationParser
- XML/JSON provider configuration classes implement hashCode/equals properly
- XML/JSON provider classes implement Comparable (based on a predefined provider order) as well as fixing the order of fields and alphabetical order withing parameters when serializing
- changed the separator in Hadoop XML type descriptors from semicolon (;) to hash (#) to conform new requirements
- shared providers that are generated using this framework are read-only on Admimn UI
- end-users can modify/remove any parameters in a provider w/o touching others",99.76790451,No_arch,0.8689

* KNOX-2551 - AliasBasedTokenStateService is the default token state service implementatation

* KNOX-2551 - Fixed parameter index in various token related log messages

* KNOX-2551 - Creating sub-nodes in ZK in case Knox Tokens are stored under /knox/security/topology/__gateway

* KNOX-2551 - To address the side effects of optimistic replication in HA mode the ZK token state service retries to fetch tokens from ZK until it's found or the configured persistence interval is exceeded

* KNOX-2551 - Avoid removing --max aliases from the unpersisted in-memory collection

* KNOX-2551 - ZK token state service performance improvements

Major changes:
- ZK token state service configures ZKRemoteAliasService to not use local keystore
- ZK token state service implements loadTokensFromPersistenceStore to avoid keystore lookup from parent; it actually does nothing as ZK entry change listeners populate in-memory collections in DefaultTokenStateService
- token eviction runs independently of loadTokensFromPersistenceStore (not like in AliasBasedTokenStateService as we no longer need to consider the global keystore locking in DefaultKeystoreService)
